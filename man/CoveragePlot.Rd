\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat object}

\item{region}{A set of genomic coordinates to show. Can be a GRanges object,
a string encoding a genomic position, a gene name, or a vector of strings
describing the genomic coordinates or gene names to plot. If a gene name is
supplied, annotations must be present in the assay.}

\item{features}{A vector of features present in another assay to plot
alongside accessibility tracks (for example, gene names).}

\item{assay}{Name of the assay to plot. If a list of assays is provided,
data from each assay will be shown overlaid on each track. The first assay in
the list will define the assay used for gene annotations, links, and peaks
(if shown). The order of assays given defines the plotting order.}

\item{split.assays}{When plotting data from multiple assays, display each
assay as a separate track. If FALSE, data from different assays are overlaid
on a single track with transparancy applied.}

\item{assay.scale}{Scaling to apply to data from different assays. Can be:
\itemize{
\item{common: plot all assays on a common scale (default)}
\item{separate: plot each assay on a separate scale ranging from zero to the
maximum value for that assay within the plotted region}
}}

\item{show.bulk}{Include coverage track for all cells combined (pseudo-bulk).
Note that this will plot the combined accessibility for all cells included in
the plot (rather than all cells in the object).}

\item{expression.assay}{Name of the assay containing expression data to plot
alongside accessibility tracks. Only needed if supplying \code{features}
argument.}

\item{expression.slot}{Name of slot to pull expression data from. Only needed
if supplying the \code{features} argument.}

\item{annotation}{Display gene annotations. Set to TRUE or FALSE to control
whether genes models are displayed, or choose "transcript" to display all
transcript isoforms, or "gene" to display gene models only (same as setting
TRUE).}

\item{peaks}{Display peaks}

\item{peaks.group.by}{Grouping variable to color peaks by. Must be a variable
present in the feature metadata. If NULL, do not color peaks by any variable.}

\item{ranges}{Additional genomic ranges to plot}

\item{ranges.group.by}{Grouping variable to color ranges by. Must be a
variable present in the metadata stored in the \code{ranges} genomic ranges.
If NULL, do not color by any variable.}

\item{ranges.title}{Y-axis title for ranges track. Only relevant if
\code{ranges} parameter is set.}

\item{region.highlight}{Region to highlight on the plot. Should be a GRanges
object containing the coordinates to highlight. By default, regions will be
highlighted in grey. To change the color of the highlighting, include a
metadata column in the GRanges object named "color" containing the color to
use for each region.}

\item{links}{Display links. This can be a TRUE/FALSE value which will
determine whether a links track is displayed, and if TRUE links for all genes
in the plotted region will be shown. Alternatively, a character vector can be
provided, giving a list of gene names to plot links for. If this is provided,
only links for those genes will be displayed in the plot.}

\item{tile}{Display per-cell fragment information in sliding windows. If
plotting multi-assay data, only the first assay is shown in the tile plot.}

\item{tile.size}{Size of the sliding window for per-cell fragment tile plot}

\item{tile.cells}{Number of cells to display fragment information for in tile
plot.}

\item{bigwig}{List of bigWig file paths to plot data from. Files can be
remotely hosted. The name of each element in the list will determine the
y-axis label given to the track.}

\item{bigwig.type}{Type of track to use for bigWig files ("line", "heatmap",
or "coverage"). Should either be a single value, or a list of values giving
the type for each individual track in the provided list of bigwig files.}

\item{bigwig.scale}{Same as \code{assay.scale} parameter, except for bigWig
files when plotted with \code{bigwig.type="coverage"}}

\item{heights}{Relative heights for each track (accessibility, gene
annotations, peaks, links).}

\item{group.by}{Name of one or more metadata columns to group (color) the
cells by. Default is the current cell identities}

\item{split.by}{A metadata variable to split the tracks by. For example,
grouping by "celltype" and splitting by "batch" will create separate tracks
for each combination of celltype and batch.}

\item{window}{Smoothing window size}

\item{extend.upstream}{Number of bases to extend the region upstream.}

\item{extend.downstream}{Number of bases to extend the region downstream.}

\item{scale.factor}{Scaling factor for track height. If NULL (default),
use the median group scaling factor determined by total number of fragments
sequences in each group.}

\item{ymax}{Maximum value for Y axis. Can be one of:
\itemize{
\item{NULL: set to the highest value among all the tracks (default)}
\item{qXX: clip the maximum value to the XX quantile (for example, q95 will
set the maximum value to 95\\% of the maximum value in the data). This can help
remove the effect of extreme values that may otherwise distort the scale.}
\item{numeric: manually define a Y-axis limit}
}}

\item{cells}{Which cells to plot. Default all cells}

\item{idents}{Which identities to include in the plot. Default is all
identities.}

\item{sep}{Separators to use for strings encoding genomic coordinates. First
element is used to separate the chromosome from the coordinates, second
element is used to separate the start from end coordinate.}

\item{max.downsample}{Minimum number of positions kept when downsampling.
Downsampling rate is adaptive to the window size, but this parameter will set
the minimum possible number of positions to include so that plots do not
become too sparse when the window size is small.}

\item{downsample.rate}{Fraction of positions to retain when downsampling.
Retaining more positions can give a higher-resolution plot but can make the
number of points large, resulting in larger file sizes when saving the plot
and a longer period of time needed to draw the plot.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[patchwork]{wrap_plots}}}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{\link[patchwork]{patchwork}} object
}
\description{
Plot frequency of Tn5 insertion events for different groups of cells within
given regions of the genome. Tracks are normalized using a per-group scaling
factor computed as the number of cells in the group multiplied by the mean
sequencing depth for that group of cells. This accounts for differences in
number of cells and potential differences in sequencing depth between groups.
}
\details{
Additional information can be layered on the coverage plot by setting several
different options in the CoveragePlot function. This includes showing:
\itemize{
\item{gene annotations}
\item{peak positions}
\item{additional genomic ranges}
\item{additional data stored in a bigWig file, which may be hosted remotely}
\item{gene or protein expression data alongside coverage tracks}
\item{peak-gene links}
\item{the position of individual sequenced fragments as a heatmap}
\item{data for multiple chromatin assays simultaneously}
\item{a pseudobulk for all cells combined}
}
